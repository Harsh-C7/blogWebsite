This website is developed using the Node.js runtime environment and the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating language. Node.js is a powerful and efficient platform for building scalable network applications, while EJS allows developers to generate dynamic HTML pages using JavaScript code embedded within the templates.

By leveraging these technologies, the website can provide a highly responsive user experience, with the ability to process data on the server-side and render dynamic content on the client-side. Additionally, Node.js and EJS make it easy for developers to maintain and update the website over time, ensuring that it remains functional and up-to-date with the latest web development best practices.
